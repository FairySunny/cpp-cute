# Get started with Cute

## Install Cute

Follow the instructions in the [Download and Install](../README.md#download-and-install) section of `README.md`.

## Hello World

Create a Cute source code file `hello.cute` and write the following code.

```cute
<< "Hello world!";
```

The code above is very simple. It contains just one line. In this code, you declare a string constant using `""` and print the string using `<<`.

Open a terminal in the same directory of `hello.cute` and use the interpreter to run the code.

```sh
cute hello.cute
```

The code outputs the hello message.

```
Hello world!
```
